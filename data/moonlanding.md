The Moon Landing Program refers to the historical efforts of various countries to land humans on the Moon. The most well-known of these programs is the Apollo program by NASA, which successfully landed humans on the Moon in 1969 4.

The Apollo program consisted of several missions, the most notable of which was Apollo 11, the first mission to land humans on the Moon. The Apollo 11 mission was commanded by Neil Armstrong, who became the first person to set foot on the lunar surface 4.

Since then, several other countries have attempted to land humans on the Moon. For instance, the Soviet Union sent several probes to the Moon but did not manage to land a human there. China has also conducted several lunar missions, with Chang'e 4 becoming the first Chinese spacecraft to land on the far side of the Moon 2.

Currently, NASA is planning the Artemis program, which aims to land the first woman and the first person of color on the Moon. This program is expected to utilize innovative technologies to explore more of the lunar surface than ever before. As part of this program, NASA plans to collaborate with commercial and international partners and establish the first long-term presence on the Moon. The Artemis program is also intended to prepare for future manned missions to Mars 1.

The Human Landing System (HLS) is a critical component of the Artemis mission. This system is responsible for transporting crew from lunar orbit to the lunar surface, acting as a lunar habitat, and then transporting the crew back to lunar orbit. In 2021, SpaceX's Starship HLS program was awarded the winning NASA bid for the production of a crewed lunar landing vehicle 2.

In summary, the Moon Landing Program represents a series of historic missions by various countries to land humans on the Moon. The current focus is on the Artemis program by NASA, which aims to build on the achievements of past missions and prepare for future manned missions to Mars.
