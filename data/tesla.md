Tesla Motors, Inc., commonly known as Tesla, is an American automaker and energy technology company specializing in electric vehicles (EVs) and clean energy products. The company was founded by Elon Musk in 2003 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California 4.

Tesla has several models in its lineup, each offering different features and specifications. Here are brief descriptions of some of them:

    Tesla Model 3: This is the entry-level sedan of the Tesla lineup. It combines EV power in a package smaller than the more expensive Model S. The Model 3 comes in several variations, including the Standard Range version, the dual-motor Long Range Model 3, and the Performance version. All Model 3 Teslas ship with a glass roof and a 15-inch landscape infotainment touchscreen in the center of the dash. The interior is rather sparse, with most features relegated to the touchscreen 4.

    Tesla Model Y: Built on the same platform as the Model 3, the Model Y is the compact SUV of the Tesla lineup. It offers 76 cubic feet of storage space, including the frunk. The Model Y comes with a glass roof, a 15-inch landscape touchscreen infotainment display, and a new 8-inch display for rear passengers placed in the center console 4.

    Tesla Model S: This is the brand’s high-end sedan. It recently received an interior and powertrain update. After the update, the Model S now ships with a more luxurious interior with ebony, walnut, or, for the Plaid trim, carbon fiber. The Model S also ships with a glass roof, a 17-inch landscape infotainment touchscreen, and a new 8-inch display for rear passengers placed in the center console 4.

    Tesla Model X: The first Tesla SUV, the Model X made a huge splash when it came to market with its Falcon Wing doors. Like the Model S, it recently received an interior and powertrain update. The most striking feature of the Model X is the Falcon Wing door setup that one would typically expect on an Italian supercar. The 2- or 3-row SUV seats up to seven passengers and with the rear seats folded offers 91 cubic feet of storage space 4.

    Tesla Cybertruck: This is a polarizing vehicle that’s not quite ready for primetime. The truck will be capable of towing 7,500, 10,000, and 14,000 pounds from the single-, dual-, and tri-motor drivetrains respectively. All three will be able to haul 3,500 pounds of payload. The interior will seat six via the center seat in the front row 4.

In addition to its vehicles, Tesla is also known for its Supercharger network, which provides free charging for Tesla owners. The company is continuously innovating and expanding its product line, including the introduction of a semi-truck and a new energy storage product called the Powerwall
